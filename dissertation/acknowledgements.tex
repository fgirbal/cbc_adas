I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my supervisor, Dr. Morteza Lahijanian, for his invaluable support and insight. Our meetings were essential to the progress of this dissertation and this project would not have been this complete without his ideas. I would also like to thank my co-supervisor, Professor Marta Kwiatkowska for giving me the opportunity to work on this project. 

I would like to thank my academic and college supervisor, Professor Alessandro Abate, for his help and availability throughout the year. Finally, I would like to thank my family in general and in particular my sister, Constança; my dad, António, for always encouraging me to be my best self and follow my dreams; and my mom, Ana, for her unconditional support and love.
